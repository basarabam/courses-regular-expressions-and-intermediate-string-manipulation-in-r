## Stringr

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "53619ffa4f"
code_zoom: 93
```

`@part1`
```str_replace()``` and ```str_replace_all()``` {{0}}

``` 
str <- c("football", "basketball", "tennis", “voleyball“)
pattern = "[aeiou]"
replace = "_"
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "_")
```{{1}}

```
[1] "f_otball"   "b_sketball" "t_nnis"     "v_leyball"
```{{2}}

``` 
str_replace_all(str, "[aeiou]", "_")
``` {{3}}

```[1] "f__tb_ll"   "b_sk_tb_ll" "t_nn_s"     "v_l_yb_ll"
```{{4}}

## Negation

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "35c11a48ab"
code_zoom: 87
```

`@part1`
- **Negation**  ```[^...]```{{1}}
- Leading ```^``` negates the list ```[...]```{{2}}
- Don't mix up with start of the line caret ```^```{{3}}
- Totaly different meaning in the list ```[^...]```{{4}}
- Only when it is immediately after the class's opening bracket {{5}}
```
> str_replace(str, "[^aeiou]", "_")
[1] "_ootball"   "_asketball" "_ennis"     "_oleyball" 
> str_replace_all(str, "[^aeiou]", "_")
[1] "_oo__a__"   "_a__e__a__" "_e__i_"     "_o_e__a__"
```{{6}}
