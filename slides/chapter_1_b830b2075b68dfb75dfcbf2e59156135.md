## 2.4. Replacing strings using regular expressions

Welcome back!
In the final section we are going to learn string replacements with Regular Expressions.

## Stringr

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "53619ffa4f"
code_zoom: 93
```

`@part1`
```str_replace()``` and ```str_replace_all()``` {{0}}

``` 
str <- c("football", "basketball", "tennis", “voleyball“)
pattern = "[aeiou]"
replacement = "_"
str_replace(str, pattern, replacement)
```{{1}}

```
[1] "f_otball"   "b_sketball" "t_nnis"     "v_leyball"
```{{2}}

``` 
str_replace_all(str, pattern, replacement)
``` {{3}}

```[1] "f__tb_ll"   "b_sk_tb_ll" "t_nn_s"     "v_l_yb_ll"
```{{4}}


`@script`
Stringr package has two functions for replacing strings. 
str_replace()
str_replace_all()
Both functions takes three arguments
First argument is usually character vector.
Pattern is a second argument in a form of string or regular expression.
Replacement is a third argument in a form of character vector, name vector or function. 
It is important to know that vector of replacements should be either of length one, or the same length as string or pattern arguments, otherwise strange behavior may occur.
For example you have a new job and your task is to replace all vowels from the names of different sports with underscores. Removing  is necessary for some letter guessing  game used in the  quiz application, your company produces.  
You have a character vector named str, containing names of some sports, for testing purpose

First, you have to define a character class of vowels, in a form of regular expression, as the pattern variable. Use square brackets, to define characters which you want to include in your search pattern, in this case vowels.
Replacement argument, of the function, will take the underscore value.

If you use str_replace function it will replace only the first vowel in the string. That can be useful in many other cases, but not in this.

You can use str_replace_all() function, with the same arguments. This function will replace all vowels in the character vector with underscore.

Suddenly your boss tells you that your task is changed and now you have to remove consonants and not vowels from the sting. 
Do not be stressed with negation in regular expressions  syntax, you can do it with just one key stroke.

## Negation

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "35c11a48ab"
code_zoom: 87
```

`@part1`
- **Negation**  ```[^...]```{{1}}
- Leading ```^``` negates the list ```[...]```{{2}}
- Don't mix up with start of the line caret ```^```{{3}}
- Totaly different meaning in the list ```[^...]```{{4}}
- Only when it is immediately after the class's opening bracket {{5}}
```
> str_replace(str, "[^aeiou]", "_")
[1] "_ootball"   "_asketball" "_ennis"     "_oleyball"{{6}}
```

```
> str_replace_all(str, "[^aeiou]", "_")
[1] "_oo__a__"   "_a__e__a__" "_e__i_"     "_o_e__a__"
```{{7}}


`@script`
If you use caret inside the square brackets the class matches any character that isn't listed.
The lading caret in the class negates the list, so rather than listing the characters you want to include
in the class, you list the characters you don't want to be included.
Don't mix up caret, with the start-of-line caret, in the square brackets, at the beginning it has totally different meaning.

## Multiple replacements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "fe76ca9ba0"
code_zoom: 60
```

`@part1`
With ```str_replace_all()``` you can perform multiple replacements by **supplying a named vector**{{1}}
```
str <- c("4 friends", "2 bars", "30 beers", "4 hangovers")
str_replace_all(str, c("4" = "four", "2" = "two", "30" = "thirty", "4" = "hangovers"))
```{{2}}

```
[1] "four friends"   "two bars"       "thirty beers"   "four hangovers"
```{{3}}


`@script`
In the str_replace functions, you can perform multiple replacements by supplying named vector instead of pattern and replacement arguments, like in the example.
So don't celebrate with friends too much, your new replacing knowledge because you are risking the hangovers.

## Inserting components of the match

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4de64cc29d"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
Instead of replacing with a fixed string, you can use **backreferences** to insert components of the match {{1}}
```
sentences <- c("The canoe birch slid on the smooth planks." 
, "Glue sheet the to the dark blue background."
, "It's to easy tell the depth of a well.")

str_replace(sentences, "([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2")
```{{2}}

```
[1] "The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."
[2] "Glue the sheet to the dark blue background."
[3] "It's easy to tell the depth of a well."
```{{3}}


`@script`
In the following example, the order of the second and third word is flipped, with backreferences what would be discussed in the next chapter.
The pattern argument is regular expression selecting three groups of one or more characters, by negating spaces.   
This is example of effective use of regular expressions in string replacing process.

## Matching with functions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "75ca73b041"
code_zoom: 75
```

`@part1`
It is possible to use replacement argument as the function
```
str_replace_all(sentences, "[aeiou]", toupper)
```

```
[1] "ThE cAnOE bIrch slId On thE smOOth plAnks."
[2] "GlUE shEEt thE tO thE dArk blUE bAckgrOUnd."
[3] "It's tO EAsy tEll thE dEpth Of A wEll."
```
or to change pattern to NA values
```
str_replace_all(sentences, "b", NA_character_)
```

```
[1] NA                                       
[2] NA                                       
[3] "It's to easy tell the depth of a well."
```


`@script`
With str_replacement functions you can use functions to do replacements, in this case to convert all vowels to upper case, or to replace vowels with NA values, like in the example.

## Stringi replacing

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c2fab64bf2"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- These functions replace, with the given replacement string, every/first/last substring of the input that matches the specified pattern.
- Many different options for fine tuning in replacement process

```
stri_replace_*_*
```

```
> stri_replace_all_charclass("aaaa", "[a]", "b", merge=FALSE)
[1] "bbbb"
```

```
> stri_replace_all_charclass("aaaa", "[a]", "b", merge = TRUE)
[1] "b"
```


`@script`
Stringi package provides huge number of functions for replacing strings.
Stringi functions replace, with the given replacement string first or last or every substring of the input that matches the specified pattern.
In the example you can see how different value for match can influence results.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "a7ec146d9b"
```

`@script`
OK, it is time to implement your new replacing knowledge. Happy stringing!!!
